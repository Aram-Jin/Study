# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

# QUESTION
#
# Build and train a neural network to predict sunspot activity using
# the Sunspots.csv dataset.
#
# Your neural network must have an MAE of 0.12 or less on the normalized dataset
# for top marks.
#
# Code for normalizing the data is provided and should not be change
